This project is an exploration of music in visual form.  Our hope is that it helps you discover something new about music, whether you're a seasoned musician or a complete newby. It is divided into three main sections:

## Learn
In this section, we first teach you some music theory, so that you have know the basics as we move along.  We go over the basics of notes, chords, and keys.  In addition, we explore how chords and keys manifest themselves in guitar tabs, showing how they vary over many songs.

## Investigate
In this section, we take a finer look at trends in recent popular music.  Specifically, we look at data from songs on the Billboard Hot 100 over the past decade, examining features across genres.  Songs have many attributes beyond they music and lyrics; we see how those attributes influence time topping the charts.

## Explore
In this section, we provide a visualization as a tool for the user to further play with some of the chord data.  You can see how chord progressions vary across genres and keys.
