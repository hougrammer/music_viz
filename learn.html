    <h1>An Exploration of Trends in Music</h1>
    <p>Welcome to our music exploration!  Our goal is to teach you some things about music theory.  Specifically we're going to go over the basic naming of the notes and how they combine into chords.  Then we will take a look at some data scraped from a guitar music website called <a href="https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/">ultimate-guitar.com</a> to show some trends in chord usage.  For this exploration, our audience is both musicians and people who know nothing about music theory.  For the former group, the first few sections will be very rudimentary, but the data towards the end will be enlightening for both.</p>

    <h2>A Crash Course on Music Theory</h2>
    <p>Here's a simple piano keyboard to play around with. Press some keys and see how notes are represented on the musical scale. Notice that the notes go up in a predicatable manner as you move left to right on the keyboard. The weird looking symbols at the top left are called clefs and the fractions control the duration of the note if we were to actually play the notes. For now, let's ignore them.</p>
    <div id="keyboardContainer"></div>
    <div id="svgNotesContainer"></div>
    <button id="backspaceButton" class="btn">Delete Note</button>

    <h3>Note Names</h3>
    <p>Each of the notes on the keyboard has a name. The white keys are simply called A, B, C, D, E, F, and G.  After G, we start at A again. Here is picture of the labeled keyboard.</p>
    <img src="img/piano.png">
    <p>What about the symbols on the black keys? The "b" is called a flat and the "#" is called a sharp.  These are modifiers to the natural (white) notes. Flats bring the pitch of a note down a half step; sharps bring them up a half step.   By a "step", we are just talking about the distance between two notes.  E.g. C and D are a whole step apart, but E and F are a half step apart because there is no black key in between them.  Moreover, each black key has two names (C# and Db are the same note).</p>

    <p>As an aside for programmers, the name of the language C++ is a joke in that it is 1 above the language C?  C# is named similarly, with it being a (half) step above C.</p>

    <h3>Chords</h3>
    <p>Chords are simply groups of notes played simultaneously.  I encourage you to go <a href="https://www.onlinepianist.com/virtual-piano">here</a> and try playing some notes. It is difficult to learn music without hearing it.  You can click the keys with your mouse or use your keyboard.  Try pressing these keys together: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Q-E-T</li>
      <li>Q-3-T</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The first chord consisted of the notes C-E-G and is called C major. The second chord differs by only one note; it's C-Eb-G (remember the "b" means flat) and is called C minor. Most people hear the major chord as happy or optimistic; the minor chord, sad or pessimistic.  Little changes can make a large difference in the feel of a song.</p>

    <p>If you really dislike being redirected to other websites, the visualization below allows you to click a note and see its major or minor chord.  Toggle major/minor with the radio button on the right.</p>

    <div id="chordsViz" style="display: inline-block;"></div>
    <div style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: top;">
      <form id="form">
        <input type="radio" name="stack" class="chordsRadio" value="Major" checked="checked">Major
        <input type="radio" name="stack" class="chordsRadio" value="Minor">Minor
      </form>
      <div>Chord:<br> <span id="chordSpan">C Major</span></div>
      <div>Notes:<br> <span id="noteSpan">[C, E, G]</span></div>
    </div>
    <script src="js/chords.js"></script>

    <p><strong>Insight: </strong>Toggling between major and minor changes only the middle note of each chord.  Also, some chords use black notes and some do not.  We'll come back to this in a bit.</p>
    
    <h3>Chord Progressions</h3>
    <p>A "chord progression" is just a sequence of chords. Try going back to the keyboard and try pressing these keys in order:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Q-E-T (C major)</li>
      <li>T-U-I (G major)</li>
      <li>Y-I-P (A minor)</li>
      <li>R-Y-I (F major)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Try playing those 4 chords in a loop. If you listen to any western pop music, things might start sounding familiar.  These four chords make a very popular progression called "I-V-vi-IV" (pronounced "1 5 6 4") in the key of C.  The numbers reference the number of keys from the root note (C is 5 this case).  Looking at the keyboard, we see that G is 4 white keys away from C, A is 5 white keys away from C, and F is 3 white keys away from C.</p>
    <p>This specific sequence of chords is extremely popular. Check out this video.</p>

    <h3>Keys</h3>
    <p>The key of a song (not to be confused with keys of a piano) governs which sharps and flats are played.  It is why some of chords in the visualization above had black keys and some did not.  For example, the D major chordhas an F# in the middle instead of an F.  Similary, a song in the <i>key</i> of D major plays generally plays F# every time there is an F note.  There are exceptions but that is the general idea.  More information can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_signature">here</a></p>
    <p>Here is a very hand-wavey list of rules to figure out which notes get sharps or flats in a major key:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Between notes 1 and 2, there must be a whole step</li>
      <li>Between notes 2 and 3, there must be a whole step</li>
      <li>Between notes 3 and 4, there must be a half step</li>
      <li>Between notes 4 and 5, there must be a whole step</li>
      <li>Between notes 5 and 6, there must be a whole step</li>
      <li>Between notes 6 and 7, there must be a half step</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Applying the above rules with C as note 1, we see that the notes in the key of C major are (C D E F G A B).  Doing the same for the key of D, we get (D E F# G A B C#).</p>

    <h2>The Data</h2>
    <p>Now that you've mastered the piano, it's time to change to guitar.  The majorty of our data is from a website called <a href="https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/">ultimate-guitar</a>.  Guitar is a very popular instrument in modern music and chord transcriptions of many songs are available, even if they aren't actually played on guitar.  However, the information on ultimate-guitar is crowdsourced from its users, which means that checks for accuracy and veracity are done by the community itself.  Our data uses the most popular submissions to ultimate-guitar, meaning they should be decent in quality, but there is no guarantee.</p>

    <p>Here is an example of a <a href="https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the_beatles/let_it_be_chords_17427">"tab"</a>.  We scraped several thousand of these tabs, pulling out the chords and metadata from each song.  We got basic information like song name and artist and also the genre and rough time when the song was written.</p>

    <p>As an aside for musicians, we treated all chords as either major or minor.  All special chords like suspended or augmented chords were treated as major.  The exception is that we treated diminished chords like minor chords.</p>

    <h3>Comparing Keys and Chords</h3>
    <p>Let's take a look at some of the most popular keys and chords used in the website.  The below plot shows the total number of each chord in our data and the total number songs with each key in our data.</p>
    <!-- Key and Chords Bar Chart-->
    <div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1542084331455' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt=' ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ke&#47;KeyandChordCounts&#47;Dashboard1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='KeyandChordCounts&#47;Dashboard1' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ke&#47;KeyandChordCounts&#47;Dashboard1&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>                <script type='text/javascript'>                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1542084331455');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script>

    <p><strong>Insight 1: </strong>The two charts are extremely similar!  This is unsurprising as the the "tonic" chord in a key (the one that shares the eponymous note name) almost always appears.  Still, with the exception of A minor, the keys and chords increase and decrease in almost lock step.  I don't have a good theory as to why A minor is special here.</p>
    <p><strong>Insight 2: </strong>C major is the most popular major key.  This is most likely due to its simplicity, lacking any sharps or flats in its key signature.  F# major (the least popular key on the website) has 6 sharps.  Remember that there are only 7 named notes so having 6 sharps is quite a lot!  The key with 7 sharps is C# major and that one is the second least popular on the website.</p>
    <p><strong>Insight 3: </strong>A minor is the most the popular minor key.  Without delving too far back into music theory, C major and A minor both have zero sharps or flats in their key signature.  Put another way, A minor is approximately equivalent in simplicity to C major.  You can read more about parallel majors/minors <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_key">here</a>.</p>

    <h3>Chords Within Keys</h3>
    <!-- Keys and Chords -->
    <p>The below visualization shows the distribution of chords within keys.  Use the drop down menu to change keys.</p>
    <div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1543006846539' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt=' ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ch&#47;ChordsandKeys&#47;ChordsandKeys&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='ChordsandKeys&#47;ChordsandKeys' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ch&#47;ChordsandKeys&#47;ChordsandKeys&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>                <script type='text/javascript'>                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1543006846539');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script>
    <p><strong>Insight 1: </strong>Let's start with C major because we're familiar with that.  The most popular are C, G, and D.  F and A minor are also popular (recall that I-V-vi-IV is C-G-Am-F in C major).  Switching to the key of G, we see even more dominance by the I-V-vi-IV chords.  </p>
    <p><strong>Insight 2: </strong>Close inspection of these plots actually brings up some questions about the accuracy of the "key" label from the website.  That is people seem to be incorrectly denoting the key of some songs.  We know this because many keys have chords that don't belong there.  For example, in the key of Db, there are way too many C major and G major chords to be correct.</p>
    <h4>A Deeper Analysis for the Musicians and Guitarists</h4>
    <p>We see the prominance of the D major chord in the C major key, but the D chord should be minor in this key.  This leads me to think that many of the songs in this dataset are simply mislabeled.  Indeed, the fact that G-D-Em-C is I-V-vi-IV in the key of G reinforces this belief.  Guitarists will know that perhaps the easiest key(s) to play in are G major and E minor, since I-V-vi-IV consist of all open chords (where as F is usually a barre chord).  Thus, I believe that people are sticking the CAGED chords into whatever key they feel like.  Also examination of less popular keys, like Db, also show a huge proportion of G chords.  It's hard to believe that so many songs are using out of key chords, providing further evidence that data from ultimate-guitar may not be very reliable.</p>

    <h3>Chord Progressions</h3>
    <p>If you're playing a song and just played the C major chord, what is the most likely chord you go to next?  The below visualization shows the probabilities of which chords follow one another.  The top circle shows the first chord and the bottom circles show the probable next chords (with deeper colored circles representing higher probabilities).  Click on the circles to switch the top chord.</p>
    <div id="progressionPlot"></div>
    <script src='js/progression.js'></script>
    <p><strong>Insight: </strong>Here is another example of the prevalence of the I-V-vi-IV progression.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Probablility of going from C to G: 35.3%</li>
      <li>Probablility of going from G to Am: 12.1%</li>
      <li>Probablility of going from C to G: 24.3%</li>
      <li>Probablility of going from F to C: 35.6%</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Keep in mind that there are 7 chords in each key.  If one were to randomly pick one of the 7 every time, the probability would only be 1/7 or 14.2%.  The transition probability from G to Am is relatively low, but the other ones are much higher than if we just picked at random.</p>

    <h3>Unique Chords</h3>
    <p>The number of unique chords in a song can be treated as some measure of song variety.  That is, if a song uses a wide variety of chords, it will have a wide variety of sounds.  This is obviously oversimplifying things, as songs can also use things like tempo and dynamics, but the below visualization shows the average number of unique chords b<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1544499900984' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt=' ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Av&#47;AverageUniqueChords&#47;AverageUniqueChordsperSong&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='AverageUniqueChords&#47;AverageUniqueChordsperSong' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Av&#47;AverageUniqueChords&#47;AverageUniqueChordsperSong&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>                <script type='text/javascript'>                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1544499900984');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    vizElement.style.width='1000px';vizElement.style.height='827px';                    var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script>

      <p><strong>Insight 1: </strong>Electronic songs have the least amount of chord variety and metal songs have the most.  The former genre is often associated with repetitiveness and the latter with more musical complexity.</p>
      <p><strong>Insight 2: </strong>Over the last two decades, chord variety has decreased.  This is commensurate with the sentiment that modern music is more simplistic than older music.</p>

      <h3>Let's Just Look at Some Songs</h3>

      <p>Regardless of the inaccuracies of the website, ultimate-guitar is a great resource for just finding out how to play a song on guitar.  We scraped about 3000 popular songs.  The below plot shows the total chords and number of unique chords in each song.  You can hover over a point to get details.  Click the legend to filter by genre or decade.  Unfortunately, most of the songs we scraped did not list the genre.  Click the plot background or the reset buttonto clear the filter.</p>

      <p><strong>Insight 1: </strong>Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody tops the unique chords chart (using 23 of the 24 possible chords in our simplified representation).</p>
      <p><strong>Insight 2: </strong>The total number of chords per tab increases as we go up in decade.  Thus, our previous conclusion that chord variety is decreasing over time may be offset slightly by the fact that there are more chords.</p>
